        zoning diagrams. This resource covers various aspects such as arrows,
        trees, annotations, north indicators, icons, logos, and more.

        In the field of architecture, site analysis is an essential component of
        the design process. Understanding the topography, environment, and
        existing conditions of a site is critical in creating a successful
        design that fits the needs of the client and meets the constraints of
        the location.
        <br />
        To aid in this process, a digital product that utilizes annotation,
        signs, and symbols can be a valuable tool for architects and designers.
        This product would consist of different types of vegetation, sun paths,
        arrows, icons, scales, and color palettes which allow you to present
        your work more effectively in your next site analysis presentation.
        <br />
        Overall, a digital product that utilizes annotation, signs, and symbols
        for site analysis in architecture would be a valuable tool for designers
        and architects. By providing a way to document and analyze site
        conditions in a clear and organized way, this product could streamline
        the design process and lead to more successful outcomes for clients and
        users.
