        In the field of architecture, site analysis is an essential component of
        the design process. Understanding the topography, environment, and
        existing conditions of a site is critical in creating a successful
        design that fits the needs of the client and meets the constraints of
        the location.
        <br />
        To aid in this process, a digital product that utilizes annotation,
        signs, and symbols can be a valuable tool for architects and designers.
        This product would consist of different types of vegetation, sun paths,
        arrows, icons, scales, and color palettes which allow you to present
        your work more effectively in your next site analysis presentation.
